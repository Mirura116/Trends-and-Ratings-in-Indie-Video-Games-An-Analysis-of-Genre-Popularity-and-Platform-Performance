This project aims to look at trends in indie video games using data from Steam and the RAWG API. It focuses on how indie games have changed over time, how theyâ€™re rated by players and critics, and which genres perform best. This project will use Python, Jupyter Notebooks, SQL, and Tableau for analysis and visualization.

This file will contain virtual environment instructions in the future!!
